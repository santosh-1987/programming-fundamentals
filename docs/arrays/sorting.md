## Sorting

Sorting is any process of arranging items systematically

In Computer world a Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list elements according to a comparison
operator on the elements.

- Sorting makes searching`(one of most frequent operation)` optimised

The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of element in the respective data structure.

### How Sorting Happens?
All Sorting algo are comparison based , It compares two elements and swap based on use case.

### Notes

- TC: O(NLogN)
- SC: O(1)/O(N) Depends on sorting algorithm
