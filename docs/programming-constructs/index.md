## Concept
## _All programming language utilise program constructs._

- In imperative languages they are used to control the order (flow) in which statements are executed (or not executed).

- There are a number of recognised basic programming constructs that can be classified as follows:
| Construct | Reference |
| ------ | ------ |
| Sequences | (programming-constructs/sequence.md) |
| Selection | [programming-constructs/selection.md]|
| Repetition | [programming-constructs/repetition.md]|
| Routine Invocation | [programming-constructs/routine_invocation.md]|
