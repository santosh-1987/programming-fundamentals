# Byte System

A computer processor is made up of multiple decisive circuits, each one of which may be either OFF or ON. These two
states
in terms of memory are represented by a 0 or 1. In order to count higher than 1, such bits (BInary digiTS) are suspended
together. A group of eight bits is known as a byte. 1 byte can represent numbers between zero (00000000) and 255 (
11111111), or 28 = 256 distinct positions.

These bytes may also be combined to represent larger numbers.
The computer represents all characters and numbers internally in the same fashion.
