## High-level programming language
In computer science, a high-level programming language is a programming language with strong abstraction from the details of the computer.

## Low-level programming language
A low-level programming language is a programming language that provides little or no abstraction from a computer's instruction set architectureâ€”commands or functions in the language map that are structurally similar to processor's instructions. Generally, this refers to either machine code or assembly language.
