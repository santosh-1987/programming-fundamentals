## Recursion
The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function.

###### In Other Words
Recursion is the process of repeating items in a self-similar way. In programming languages, if a program allows you to call a function inside the same function, then it is called a recursive call of the function.

### When to Loop? When to Recurse?
> A loop is used to perform a repetitive block of code as many times as necessary for the program.

 _A big difference between recursion and iteration is the way that they end. While a loop executes the block of code, checking each time to see if it is at the end of the sequence, there is no such sequential end for recursive code._

### When should I use recursion?

_Recursion is made for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller, repetitive problems. It is especially good for working on things that have many possible branches and are too complex for an iterative approach._
